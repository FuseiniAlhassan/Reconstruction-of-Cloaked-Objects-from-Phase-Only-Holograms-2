![](refraction_cloak_ray_demo.png)

**This codebase contains two main simulations:**
1. Refraction Cloak Ray Tracing
â€¢ 	Purpose: Simulates how light rays bend around a cloaked region using a gradient-index (GRIN) medium.
â€¢ 	Core Concept: Based on Fermatâ€™s Principle, light rays follow paths that minimize optical distance. By engineering a spatially varying refractive index, rays are guided around a circular region, effectively "cloaking" it.
**â€¢ 	Key Functions:**
â€¢ 	: Creates a 2D refractive index field with a cloaked region.
â€¢ 	: Numerically traces rays through the medium using gradient-based updates.
â€¢ 	: Visualizes the refractive index and ray paths, optionally animating them.
â€¢ 	Output: Static image () and animated video () saved to the desktop.
2. Holographic Camouflage Simulation
â€¢ 	Purpose: Demonstrates how a phase-only hologram can reconstruct a background scene, effectively hiding an object.
â€¢ 	Core Concept: Uses angular spectrum propagation to simulate light field evolution and reconstruct a target image from a hologram.
**â€¢ 	Key Functions:**
â€¢ 	: Implements angular spectrum method for wave propagation.
â€¢ 	: Generates a synthetic background pattern.
â€¢ 	: Extracts phase-only hologram from a complex wavefront.
â€¢ 	Output: Three-panel comparison image () and the hologram phase map ().

**ðŸ“„ Abstract**
This project presents two computational optics simulations that explore advanced concepts in wave and ray optics. The first module models a gradient-index (GRIN) medium that bends light rays around a circular region, demonstrating a rudimentary form of optical cloaking. The second module simulates holographic camouflage using phase-only holography and angular spectrum propagation, reconstructing a background scene to obscure an object. Both simulations leverage Pythonâ€™s scientific stack (NumPy, Matplotlib) and produce visual outputs that illustrate the principles of refraction and wavefront engineering. These tools offer intuitive insight into modern photonics and computational imaging.
